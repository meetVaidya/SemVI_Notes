## What is Morphology?

Morphology is the study of the internal structure of words and the rules by which words are formed. It explores how smaller units of meaning (morphemes) come together to form words.

- **Morpheme**: The smallest grammatical unit in a language.
- **Examples**:
  - "unhappiness" → un- (prefix) + happy (root) + -ness (suffix)
  - "dogs" → dog (root) + -s (plural suffix)

## Importance in NLP

Understanding word structure is crucial in many Natural Language Processing tasks such as:

- Information Retrieval
- Machine Translation
- Text Normalization
- Part-of-Speech Tagging

## Key Concepts

- **Root**: The core meaning-bearing unit.
- **Affix**: Prefixes, suffixes, infixes (though rare in English).
- **Inflection**: Alters a word to express grammatical attributes (e.g., tense, number).
- **Derivation**: Forms a new word by adding a morpheme (e.g., “kind” → “unkind”).

## Inflection vs Derivation

| Aspect     | Inflection              | Derivation                 |
| ---------- | ----------------------- | -------------------------- |
| Meaning    | Does not change meaning | Often changes word meaning |
| POS Change | Usually retains POS     | Often changes POS          |
| Examples   | walk → walked           | happy → unhappiness        |
