Morphological processing can be broadly divided into two main types:

## 1. Inflectional Morphology

Focuses on grammatical variations of the same word.

- **Purpose**: Express grammatical distinctions like tense, number, gender, case, etc.
- **Example**: 
  - "talk" → "talked" (past tense)
  - "dog" → "dogs" (plural)
- **Does not** change the part of speech or base meaning of the word.

## 2. Derivational Morphology

Used to create new words by modifying the root with affixes.

- **Purpose**: Form new words with different meanings and often different parts of speech.
- **Example**:
  - "teach" (verb) → "teacher" (noun)
  - "happy" → "unhappiness"

## Applications in NLP

- **Token Normalization**: Reduces surface form variability.
- **Text Mining**: Helps group words with similar meanings.
- **Machine Learning**: Features from root forms improve model generalization.

## Challenges in Morphological Analysis

- Irregular forms (e.g., "go" → "went")
- Compound words and idioms
- Languages with rich morphology (e.g., Turkish, Finnish)
