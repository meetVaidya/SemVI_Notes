## What Is Constituency Parsing?  
- **Syntactic parsing** (i.e. constituency parsing) is the process of taking a flat string of words and assigning it a hierarchical structure—a **parse tree**—according to a CFG .

## Parse Trees  
- A **parse tree** (or derivation tree) shows how the start symbol **S** expands, via CFG rules, into the sequence of words in your sentence.  
- **Nodes** are non-terminals (e.g., NP, VP), **leaves** are terminals (actual words).  
- Reading the tree top-down and left-to-right corresponds to the rule-expansions that “generate” the sentence.

## Why Parse? Applications  
1. **Grammar Checking**  
   - Sentences that fail to parse under your CFG may contain grammatical errors (or at least be ill-formed) .  
2. **Semantic Analysis**  
   - Parse trees serve as the bridge from raw text to meaning representations—e.g., guiding how you compose word-level semantics into sentence-level semantics .  
3. **Further NLP Tasks**  
   - Constituency parses feed into machine translation, information extraction, coreference resolution, etc., by revealing the internal phrase structure.

### In a Nutshell  
Constituency parsing uses a CFG to uncover the nested, phrase-based organization of a sentence, representing it as a tree that both reflects grammatical constituency and underpins downstream language-understanding applications
