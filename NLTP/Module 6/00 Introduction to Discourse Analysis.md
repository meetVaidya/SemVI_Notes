## What is Discourse Analysis?

Discourse analysis is concerned with understanding language beyond the level of a single sentence. It involves examining how sequences of sentences are structured and interpreted in context.

*   **Definition of Discourse:**
    *   A sequence of sentences that must be interpreted with respect to its context.
    *   Language used above the sentence level.
    *   A collection of interrelated sentences that form a coherent group.
*   **Coherence:** For a set of sentences to make sense, they must be related to each other.
*   **Discourse Structure:** This refers to an underlying structure above the sentence level that is necessary for the interpretation of text.

## Key Aspects of Discourse Analysis

Discourse analysis encompasses several tasks, including:

1.  **Coreference/Cohesion Resolution:**
    *   This involves identifying what pronouns or other referring expressions refer to within the discourse.
    *   Example: Finding the referent for "he" or "it" in a text.
    *   This works at the discourse level to understand connections between entities.

2.  **Determining Relationships Between Sentences (Coherence Relations):**
    *   Understanding how sentences or clauses relate to each other (e.g., cause-effect, elaboration, contrast).
    *   This is crucial for tasks like summarization, where the importance of different sentences needs to be assessed.
    *   Example:
        *   Text: "First Union Corp is continuing to wrestle with severe problems. According to industry insiders at Paine Webber, their president, John R. Georgius, is planning to announce his retirement tomorrow."
        *   Summary: "First Union Corp President John R. Georgius is planning to announce his retirement tomorrow."
        *   To build this summary, one needs to recognize that the second sentence provides more central information.
    *   These relationships are called **coherence relations**, and identifying them and the overall **discourse structure** is a key task.

The study of discourse involves understanding both the individual elements (like entities and their references) and the larger structure that connects these elements into a meaningful whole. This includes **Discourse Structure Parsing**, which aims to identify the relational structure of discourse.
