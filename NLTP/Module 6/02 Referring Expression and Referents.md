## Reference Resolution: Key Terminology

*   **Reference:** A linguistic expression used to denote an entity or individual.
    *   Example: In "Ram...saw **his** friend... **He** went to meet **him**.", "his," "He," "him" are references.
*   **Reference Resolution:** The task of determining which entities are referred to by which linguistic expressions.
*   **Referring Expression:** The natural language expression used to perform reference.
*   **Referent:** The entity that is being referred to.
*   **Corefer:** Two expressions referring to the same entity.
*   **Antecedent:** The earlier expression an anaphor refers to.
*   **Anaphora & Anaphoric Expression:** Reference to a previously introduced entity, and the expression used.
*   **Discourse Model:** Model of entities and their relationships in the discourse.
*   **Discourse Context:** Shared knowledge and preceding text influencing reference.
*   **Situational Context:** Real-world environment affecting reference.
*   **Evoked:** First mention of a referent creates its representation in the discourse model.
*   **Accessed:** Subsequent mentions access this representation.
## Types of Referring Expressions

1.  **Indefinite Noun Phrases:** Introduce new entities.
    *   Example: *Ram had gone to bring him **some food**.*
2.  **Definite Noun Phrases:** Refer to identifiable entities.
    *   Example: *I used to read **The Times of India**.*
3.  **Pronouns:** Definite reference to salient entities.
    *   Example: *Ram laughed as loud as **he** could.*
4.  **Demonstratives:** (e.g., "this," "that") Point to entities, often relying on context.
    *   Example: ***This** is interesting.*
5.  **Names (Proper Nouns):** Directly name entities.
    *   Example: *Ram*
6.  **One Anaphora:** Uses "one" to refer to an entity of the same type.
    *   Example: *John has two girlfriends, but I only have **one**.*

## Types of Referents

Some referent types complicate resolution:

1.  **Inferrables (Bridging References):** The referent is not explicitly evoked but inferentially related to an evoked entity.
    *   Example: *I almost bought an Acura Integra today, but a **'door'** had a dent...* (door *of the Acura*).
2.  **Discontinuous Sets:** Plural expressions referring to sets of entities not evoked together.
    *   Example: *John has an Acura, and Mary has a Mazda. **They** drive **them** all the time.* ("They" = {John, Mary}; "them" = {Acura, Mazda}).
3.  **Generics:** Referring expressions denoting a class of entities in general, not specific instances.
    *   Example: *I saw 6 Acura Integras today. **'They'** are the coolest cars.* ("They" = Acura Integras in general).
