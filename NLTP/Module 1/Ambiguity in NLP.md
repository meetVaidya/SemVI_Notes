- An **input** is ambiguous if there are multiple alternative ambiguous linguistic structures that can be built for it.
- It is a situation where a word or a sentence may have more than one meaning.
- This situation makes it hard for machines to correctly understand natural human language

#### Types of Ambiguities in NLP:

1. **Lexical Ambiguity**  
    A single word has multiple meanings.
    
    - Example: _“bank”_ → can mean **financial institution** or **riverbank**.
        
2. **Syntactic (Structural) Ambiguity**  
    A sentence can be parsed in more than one way due to its structure.
    
    - Example: _“I saw the man with the telescope.”_  
        → Did **I** have the telescope, or **the man**?
        
3. **Semantic Ambiguity**  
    A sentence has multiple meanings even if the structure is clear.
    
    - Example: _“The chicken is ready to eat.”_  
        → Is the **chicken the food**, or **the one that will eat**?
        
4. **Pragmatic Ambiguity**  
    The meaning depends on context or speaker intention.
    
    - Example: _“Can you pass the salt?”_  
        → Literally a question, but pragmatically a **request**.
