## 1. Question Answering (QA)

*   **Focus:** Building systems that automatically answer questions posed by humans in natural language.
*   **Process:** These systems need to understand the question, find relevant information from a knowledge base or documents, and formulate a coherent answer.
*   **Examples:** Virtual assistants (Siri, Alexa, Google Assistant), search engine snippets, customer support bots.

## 2. Spam Detection

*   **Focus:** Identifying and filtering unwanted emails (spam) from a user's inbox.
*   **Process:** NLP techniques are used to analyze the content and metadata of emails (e.g., sender, subject, body text) to classify them as spam or not spam (ham). This often involves machine learning models trained on features extracted from email text.

## 3. Sentiment Analysis

*   **Focus:** Determining the sentiment, opinion, or emotion expressed in a piece of text.
*   **Process:** Implemented through a combination of NLP and statistics (often machine learning). It involves assigning values to the text (e.g., positive, negative, neutral) and identifying the mood or emotional tone (e.g., happy, sad, angry).
*   **Applications:** Analyzing customer reviews, social media monitoring, market research.

## 4. Machine Translation (MT)

*   **Focus:** Automatically translating text or speech from one natural language to another.
*   **Process:** Modern MT systems (like Neural Machine Translation) use deep learning models trained on vast amounts of parallel text data.
*   **Example:** Google Translator.

## 5. Spelling Correction

*   **Focus:** Detecting and correcting spelling errors in text.
*   **Process:** Involves checking words against a dictionary and suggesting corrections for misspelled words based on edit distance or probabilistic models.
*   **Examples:**
    *   Word processors like MS-Word, PowerPoint.
    *   Autocorrect features in mobile keyboards.
    > **Example** Wrong **Speling** will be underlined with the red color as done in this sentence.

## 6. Chatbots

*   **Focus:** Implementing conversational agents (chatbots) that can interact with humans using natural language.
*   **Process:** Chatbots use NLP to understand user queries/statements and generate appropriate responses. They can range from simple rule-based bots to sophisticated AI-powered conversational systems.
*   **Applications:** Customer service, information retrieval, personal assistants.
