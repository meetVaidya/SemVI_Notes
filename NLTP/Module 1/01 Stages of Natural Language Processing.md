To enable a program to converse with humans or process language effectively, it must understand various linguistic levels. Natural Language Processing (NLP) is typically performed in several phases or stages, each focusing on a different aspect of language.

*   To converse with a human, a program must understand:
    *   **Syntax (grammar):** The grammatical structure of sentences.
    *   **Semantics (word meaning):** The meaning of words and sentences.
    *   **Morphology (word level analysis):** The structure and formation of words.
    *   **Pragmatics (conversation):** How context influences the interpretation of meaning.
*   There are certain phases in which Natural Language Processing is performed.

## Overview of NLP Stages/Steps
NLP involves a sequence of analysis levels, often visualized as a pipeline:
1.  **[[02 Morphological Analysis|Morphological Analysis]]:** (Word-Level Analysis)
2.  **Syntactic Analysis:** (Sentence-Level Analysis)
3.  **Semantic Analysis:** (Sentence-Level Analysis)
4.  **Discourse Analysis:** (Sentence-Level Analysis, often beyond single sentences)
5.  **Pragmatic Analysis:** (Sentence-Level Analysis, highly context-dependent)
