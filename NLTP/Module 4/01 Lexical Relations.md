## Homonymy vs. Polysemy
Words can share form but differ in whether their senses are related.

### Homonymy  
- **Definition:** A single form with two or more **unrelated** meanings (distinct etymologies).  
- **Characteristics:**  
  - No semantic overlap.  
  - Separate dictionary entries.  
- **Examples:**  
  - *bank¹*: “river edge”  
  - *bank²*: “financial institution” :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}:contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}  
- *(Image context: Illustration showing “bat” as animal vs. “bat” as baseball equipment.)*

### Polysemy  
- **Definition:** A single form with multiple **related** senses (shared etymology).  
- **Characteristics:**  
  - Sense extensions often metaphorical or metonymic.  
  - Treated as one dictionary entry with sub‑senses.  
- **Examples:**  
  - *head*:  
    - “Anatomical part of body”  
    - “Leader of department”  
    - “Foothill of glacier” :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}:contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}

## Synonymy
Words or expressions with **similar or identical** meanings in at least some contexts.

- **Perfect synonyms** are rare; differences arise in:  
  - **Register:** (e.g., *childlike* vs. *childish*)  
  - **Connotation:** (e.g., *slender* vs. *skinny*)  
  - **Collocational preferences:** (e.g., “strong tea” vs. *“powerful tea”*)  
- **Principle of Contrast:** If two forms are distinct, they must convey at least some nuance difference. :contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}:contentReference[oaicite:5]{index=5}

## Antonymy
Pairs of words expressing **opposite** semantic values.

| Type              | Definition                                    | Examples                    |
|-------------------|-----------------------------------------------|-----------------------------|
| **Gradable**      | Opposites on a continuous scale               | *hot* ↔ *cold*, *tall* ↔ *short* |
| **Complementary** | Mutually exclusive, no middle ground          | *alive* ↔ *dead*            |
| **Relational**    | Opposites defined by relationship             | *buy* ↔ *sell*, *parent* ↔ *child* :contentReference[oaicite:6]{index=6}:contentReference[oaicite:7]{index=7} |

## Hyponymy & Hypernymy
Hierarchical “is‑a” relationships structuring lexical taxonomy.

- **Hypernym (superordinate):** Broad category term.  
- **Hyponym (subordinate):** More specific instance of that category.  
- **Transitivity:** If A IS‑A B and B IS‑A C, then A IS‑A C. :contentReference[oaicite:8]{index=8}:contentReference[oaicite:9]{index=9}

#### Examples
- *vehicle* (hypernym) → *car*, *bicycle*, *airplane* (hyponyms)  
- *flower* (hypernym) → *rose*, *tulip*, *daisy* (hyponyms)

## Meronymy & Holonymy
Part–whole semantics capturing how entities compose.

| Relation              | Description                                               | Example                     |
|-----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------|
| **Part Meronymy**     | X is a component part of Y                                | *wheel* is part of *car*    |
| **Member Meronymy**   | X is a member of a Y‑class or collective                  | *professor* is member of *faculty* |
| **Substance Meronymy**| X is the material substance of Y                          | *flour* is substance of *bread* :contentReference[oaicite:10]{index=10}:contentReference[oaicite:11]{index=11} |
| **Holonymy**          | Inverse of meronymy: Y is a whole that includes X as part | *car* is holonym of *wheel* |
