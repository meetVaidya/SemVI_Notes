## Supervised Methods
- Train classifiers (SVMs, memory‑based) on sense‑annotated corpora.  
- **Feature space:** Local collocations, POS tags, syntactic dependencies.  
- **Drawback:** Requires large manually labeled data. :contentReference[oaicite:76]{index=76}:contentReference[oaicite:77]{index=77}  

## Semi‑supervised / Bootstrapping
- Seed with small annotated set; iteratively label new contexts.  
- Leverages unannotated corpora to expand training data.  

## Unsupervised Methods
- Context clustering into sense groups without labels.  

## Hybrid Methods
- Combine knowledge‑based and corpus‐based signals for robust performance.
