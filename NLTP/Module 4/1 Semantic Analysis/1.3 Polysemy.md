**Polysemy** describes the phenomenon where a single word has several closely related senses or meanings.

*   **Key Characteristic:** The different senses are related to each other, often through metaphorical extension or other semantic shifts. Native speakers usually have a clear intuition that these senses are connected.
*   **Etymology:**
    *   `poly` means "many"
    *   `semy` means "meaning"
*   **Definition:** The same word which has many RELATED meanings. Polysemy is the state or phenomenon in which words have more than one meaning, and these meanings are considered to be etymologically related.
*   The concrete form of polysemy is called a "polyseme."
