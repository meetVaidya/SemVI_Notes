**Synonymy** is the lexical relation where two or more different words (lexemes) have the same or very similar meanings in some or all contexts.

*   **Synonyms:** Words that share a meaning.
    *   `filbert` / `hazelnut`
    *   `couch` / `sofa`
    *   `big` / `large`
    *   `automobile` / `car`
    *   `vomit` / `throw up`
    *   `Water` / `Hâ‚‚O`
    *   `youth` / `adolescent`

## Imperfect Synonymy

It's important to note that there are probably **no examples of perfect synonymy**, where words are interchangeable in absolutely all contexts without any change in nuance, connotation, or register.

*   Even if many aspects of meaning are identical, synonyms may not preserve acceptability based on:
    *   Politeness
    *   Slang
    *   Register (formal vs. informal)
    *   Genre
    *   Collocations

*   **The Linguistic Principle of Contrast:** A difference in linguistic form usually implies a difference in meaning, however subtle.

## Synonymy is a Relation Between Senses

Synonymy is more accurately described as a relation between word senses rather than just words themselves. A word can have multiple senses, and only one of those senses might be synonymous with a sense of another word.

**Example: `big` vs. `large`**

*   Are they always synonyms?
    *   "How **big** is that plane?" (Here, `large` could also be used: "How **large** is that plane?")
    *   "Would I be flying on a **large** or small plane?" (Here, `big` could also be used)

*   Consider this context:
    *   "Miss Nelson became a kind of **big** sister to Benjamin." (meaning older, or in a mentoring role)
    *   "?Miss Nelson became a kind of **large** sister to Benjamin." (This sounds odd because `large` typically refers to physical size and lacks the "older/mentor" sense that `big` can have in this context.)

*   **Why the difference?**
    *   `big` has a sense that means being older, or grown up.
    *   `large` lacks this specific sense.

Therefore, two lexemes are considered synonyms if they can be successfully substituted for each other in *some* situations, indicating an overlap in at least one of their senses.
