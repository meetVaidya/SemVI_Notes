**Semantic analysis** is the process of relating syntactic structures, from the levels of phrases, clauses, sentences and paragraphs to the level of the writing as a whole, to their language-independent meanings. It involves understanding the meaning of words, phrases, and sentences.

## Relationships Between Word Meanings
*   **[[1.2 Homonymy|Homonymy]]:** Words with the same form but different, unrelated meanings.
*   **[[1.3 Polysemy|Polysemy]]:** A single word with multiple, related meanings.
*   **Synonymy:** Different words that have the same or very similar meanings.
*   **Antonymy:** Words that have opposite meanings.
*   **Hypernymy:** A word whose meaning encompasses a class of more specific words (its hyponyms). (e.g., "animal" is a hypernym of "dog").
*   **Hyponymy:** A word whose meaning is more specific than a general class to which it belongs (its hypernym). (e.g., "dog" is a hyponym of "animal").
*   **Meronomy:** A part-whole relationship where one word represents a part of another word (e.g., "wheel" is a meronym of "car").

## Lemma and Wordform

Understanding the distinction between a lemma and a wordform is crucial:

*   **Wordform:** The actual form of a word as it appears in text or speech.
    *   Example: `banks`, `sung`, `duermes`
*   **Lemma:** The canonical or dictionary form of a set of wordforms. It's the base form.
    *   Example: `bank` (for banks), `sing` (for sung), `dormir` (for duermes)

## Lemmas Have Senses (Word Senses)

A single lemma can have multiple distinct meanings or "senses."

*   **Sense (or Word Sense):** A discrete representation of one aspect of a word's meaning. It can also be referred to as a "concept" which is the meaning component of a word.

**Example: Lemma "bank"**
The lemma "bank" can have multiple meanings:
*   **Sense 1 (Financial Institution):** "...a **bank** can hold the investments in a custodial account..."
*   **Sense 2 (River Bank):** "...as agriculture burgeons on the east **bank** the river will shrink even more"

**Example: Lemma "pepper"**
*   **Sense 1:** Spice from pepper plant
*   **Sense 2:** The pepper plant itself
*   **Sense 3:** Another similar plant (Jamaican pepper)
*   **Sense 4:** Another plant with peppercorns (California pepper)
*   **Sense 5:** *Capsicum* (i.e., chili, paprika, bell pepper, etc.)

There are relations between these different senses of words.
