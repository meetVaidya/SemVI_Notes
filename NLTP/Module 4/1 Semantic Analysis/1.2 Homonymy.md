**Homonymy** is a sense relation where one form (word) has different, unrelated meanings. These are essentially different words that happen to share the same form (spelling and/or pronunciation).

*   **Key Characteristic:** No relatedness in meaning between the senses.
*   Dictionaries typically treat homonyms as separate entries.

**Etymology:**
*   Derived from Greek:
    *   `homo` means "same"
    *   `nym` means "name"

**Definition:** Words having the same spelling and pronunciation, but with two or more distinct and unrelated meanings.

**Examples:**

1.  **Bank:**
    *   `bank1`: Side of a river
    *   `bank2`: Financial institution

2.  **Flat:**
    *   **1. Having no variations in height.**
        *   *"The land around here is flat."*
    *   **2. Uninteresting.**
        *   *"The party was a bit flat."*
    *   **3. Absolute.**
        *   *"His claim was in flat contradiction to experimental results."*
        *   *"I'm not going to the party and that's flat."*
    *   **4. (Music, note) Lowered by one semitone.**
