Recurrent architectures can be organized to suit various input-output mapping patterns:

- **One-to-one**
  - **Definition**: A single input produces a single output.
  - **Example**: Image classification (e.g. a single image → one label).

- **One-to-many**
  - **Definition**: A single input generates a variable-length sequence of outputs.
  - **Example**: Image captioning (one image → a sentence describing it).

- **Many-to-one**
  - **Definition**: A sequence of inputs is summarized into a single output.
  - **Example**: Sentiment analysis (sequence of words → one sentiment label).

- **Many-to-many (non-matching)**
  - **Definition**: Input and output are both sequences, but with potentially different lengths.
  - **Example**: Machine translation (source-language sentence → target-language sentence).

- **Many-to-many (matching)**
  - **Definition**: Input and output are sequences of the same length, often aligned step-by-step.
  - **Example**: Video frame classification (each input frame → a corresponding class label per frame).

These patterns guide the choice of where and how to apply loss functions and how hidden states flow through the network.
