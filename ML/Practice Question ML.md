#### Explain the fundamental differences between value-based and policy-based learning strategies. Why might an agent prefer one over the other in certain environments? 
| **Aspect**           | **Value-Based**                                                                     | **Policy-Based**                               |
| -------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| **Goal**             | Learn a value function (e.g., Q(s,a)Q(s,a)) to derive the optimal policy indirectly | Learn the policy $\pi$                         |
| **Output**           | Optimal value function → implied policy                                             | Optimal policy (stochastic or deterministic)   |
| **Action Selection** | Uses ε-greedy or other exploration strategy over value estimates                    | Samples from or optimizes the policy directly  |
| **Stability**        | Can be unstable due to bootstrapping                                                | More stable convergence                        |
| **Convergence**      | May oscillate in complex environments                                               | Smoother convergence but prone to local optima |
| **Suitable For**     | Discrete action spaces                                                              | Continuous or high-dimensional action spaces   |
| **Examples**         | Q-Learning, DQN                                                                     | REINFORCE, Actor-Critic                        |
**Why Choose One Over the Other?**
- **Use Value-Based when:**
 
    - Action space is small and discrete
        
    - You want a simple, efficient solution (e.g., Q-learning)
        
- **Use Policy-Based when:**
    
    - Action space is continuous (e.g., robotics)
        
    - Stochastic policies are needed (e.g., exploration in partial observability)
        
    - Value-based methods struggle to converge
