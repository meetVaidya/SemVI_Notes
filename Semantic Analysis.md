#### Definition
- **Semantic analysis** in NLP is the process of understanding the **meaning** of words, phrases, and sentences.
- a computer understand the meaning of a text by **analyzing the text as a whole** and **not by looking at individual words**
#### Key Points:
- It maps natural language to a form of **machine-understandable meaning**.
- Resolves **ambiguity** (e.g., word sense disambiguation).
- Identifies **relationships** between entities (e.g., who did what to whom).
- Handles **semantic roles**, **named entities**, **co-reference**, and **contextual meaning**.
#### Components:
1. **Lexical Semantics** – studies word meanings and relationships (e.g., synonyms, antonyms).
2. **Compositional Semantics** – determines the meaning of a sentence from its parts.
3. **Named Entity Recognition (NER)** – identifies proper names like people, places, and organizations.
4. **[[Word Sense Disambiguation]] (WSD)** – selects the correct meaning of a word based on context.
#### Example:
Sentence: _“Apple is looking to buy a startup in the AI sector.”_  
Semantic analysis would determine:
- “Apple” refers to the tech company, not the fruit.
- The action involves a potential **acquisition**.
- The object of acquisition is a **startup in AI**.
