In constraint-based recommenders, constraints are the rules or conditions that relate customer requirements to product features. The recommender system uses these constraints to ensure that the recommended items satisfy the explicit needs and preferences expressed by the user. Typically, the knowledge base of such a system consists of two sets of variables—those representing customer attributes (VC) and those representing product attributes (VPROD)—and three different sets of constraints (CR, CF, CPROD). These constraints define how the values of customer variables and product variables must relate to each other, essentially filtering out options that do not meet the user's requirements and enabling the system to find suitable recommendations by solving these constraints.
