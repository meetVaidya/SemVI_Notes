Constraint-based recommenders are a type of knowledge-based recommender system characterized by the use of explicit rules and predefined knowledge bases to relate customer requirements with product features. They differ from case-based recommenders in how they calculate solutions: while case-based methods rely on similarity metrics, constraint-based recommenders use constraint satisfaction algorithms or conjunctive database queries to find recommendations. Both types collect user requirements, propose repairs for inconsistent requirements when no solutions are found, and provide explanations for the recommendation results. Typically, the knowledge base in a constraint-based recommender consists of two sets of variables (representing customer and product attributes) and three sets of constraints that define relationships and restrictions between these variables.
