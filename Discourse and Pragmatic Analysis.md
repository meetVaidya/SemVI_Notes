### **Discourse Analysis** in NLP:

Discourse analysis focuses on understanding how **multiple sentences** relate to each other to form coherent meaning across **paragraphs or conversations**. It's about the **flow of information** and **context** beyond individual sentences.
#### Key Goals:
* Track **coherence** and **consistency** across sentences.
* Resolve **co-reference** (e.g., “John went home. *He* was tired.” → “He” = “John”).
* Understand **topic shifts**, **discourse markers** (e.g., “however,” “therefore”), and logical relations (cause-effect, contrast, etc.).
### **Pragmatic Analysis** in NLP:

Pragmatic analysis interprets the **intended meaning** of language in **specific contexts**, including speaker intention, implied meaning, and situational cues.

#### Key Goals:
* Understand implied meaning of a word based on the context.
* Resolve **speech acts** (e.g., “Can you open the window?” → request, not a question).
* Incorporate **world knowledge** and **context** (e.g., sarcasm, politeness).

#### Example:

Conversation:
**Person A:** “It’s cold in here.”
**Discourse analysis** connects it to prior sentences in the dialogue.
**Pragmatic analysis** might infer it's a **request to close the window**, not just a weather report.
