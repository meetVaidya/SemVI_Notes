#### Definition
- Syntactic analysis (also called parsing) in Natural Language Processing (NLP) is the process of analyzing the grammatical structure of a sentence.

#### Key Points:
- It checks **syntax** (structure), not **semantics** (meaning).
- The goal is to build a **parse tree** or **syntax tree** representing sentence structure.
- It identifies **parts of speech** (nouns, verbs, etc.) and their relationships (subject, object, modifier, etc.).
- set of rules needed to ensure a sentence is grammatically correct
#### Types:
1. **Constituency Parsing** – breaks a sentence into nested phrases or constituents (NP, VP, etc.).
2. **Dependency Parsing** – shows how each word depends on another (head-dependent relations).
#### Example:
Sentence: _“The cat sat on the mat.”_  
Syntactic analysis might reveal:
- "The cat" is a noun phrase (subject).
- "sat on the mat" is a verb phrase (predicate).
- "on the mat" is a prepositional phrase modifying "sat".
