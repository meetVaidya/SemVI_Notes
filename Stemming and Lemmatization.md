| 1   | Stemming is faster because it chops words without knowing the context of the word in given sentences.     | Lemmatization is slower as compared to stemming but it knows the context of the word before proceeding.             |
| 2   | It is a rule-based approach.                                                                              | It is a dictionary-based approach.                                                                                  |
| 3   | Accuracy is less.                                                                                         | Accuracy is more as compared to Stemming.                                                                           |
| 4   | When we convert any word into root-form then stemming may create the non-existence meaning of a word.     | Lemmatization always gives the dictionary meaning word while converting into root-form.                             |
| 5   | Stemming is preferred when the meaning of the word is not important for analysis. Example: Spam Detection | Lemmatization would be recommended when the meaning of the word is important for analysis. Example: Question Answer |

**Stemming and Lemmatization: A Brief Overview**

**Stemming** and **Lemmatization** are two techniques used in Natural Language Processing (NLP) to reduce words to their base or root form.

* **Stemming**: a simple, rule-based approach that removes prefixes and suffixes to obtain the stem. However, stemming may not always result in a valid or meaningful word.
* **Lemmatization**: a more advanced, dictionary-based approach that uses a vocabulary to map words to their base or root form (the lemma). Lemmatization ensures that the resulting word is a valid, dictionary-recognized term.

The key differences between stemming and lemmatization are:
* **Accuracy**: Lemmatization is generally more accurate than stemming.
* **Context**: Lemmatization considers the context of the word, whereas stemming does not.
* **Output**: Lemmatization produces a valid, dictionary-recognized word, whereas stemming may not.
