**1. Region Proposal Generation (Selective Search):**

- **Input:** The input is the original image that you want to detect objects in.
    
- **Selective Search:** The selective search algorithm is applied to the image. This algorithm aims to identify potential object regions based on color, texture, size, and shape similarity.
    
- **Output:** A set of approximately 2000 region proposals. Each region proposal is a rectangular bounding box that potentially contains an object.
    

**2. Feature Extraction (CNN - AlexNet or VGG):**

- **Input:** The set of region proposals (bounding boxes) generated by selective search.
    
- **Image Warping:** Each region proposal is cropped from the original image and then warped or resized to a fixed size (227x227 pixels for AlexNet). This is necessary because the CNN expects a fixed-size input.
    
- **CNN Forward Pass:** The warped region proposal is passed through the pre-trained CNN (AlexNet or VGG). The CNN performs a forward pass, extracting features from the region.
    
- **Feature Vector Output:** The CNN outputs a feature vector for each region proposal. This feature vector is a high-dimensional representation (e.g., 4096 dimensions) that captures the visual characteristics of the region.
    

**3. Object Classification (SVM):**

- **Input:** The feature vectors extracted from the CNN for each region proposal.
    
- **SVM Classification:** For each object class (e.g., car, person, dog), a separate Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier is used. Each SVM takes the feature vector as input and predicts a score indicating the likelihood that the region contains an object of that class.
    
- **Output:** A set of classification scores for each region proposal, one score for each object class.
    

**4. Bounding Box Regression (Linear Regression):**

- **Input:** The feature vectors extracted from the CNN for each region proposal, and the initial bounding box coordinates from selective search.
    
- **Linear Regression:** For each object class, a separate linear regression model is used. This model takes the CNN feature vector as input and predicts adjustments to the bounding box coordinates (center, width, and height).
    
- **Output:** Refined bounding box coordinates for each region proposal, adjusted to better fit the object.
    

**5. Non-Maximum Suppression (NMS):**

- **Input:** The set of bounding boxes with their associated classification scores.
    
- **NMS Algorithm:** NMS is applied to filter out redundant bounding boxes. It works by iteratively selecting the bounding box with the highest confidence score and suppressing all other bounding boxes that have a high overlap (measured by Intersection over Union - IoU) with the selected box.
    
- **Output:** A final set of bounding boxes, each representing a detected object with a specific class and location.
    

In summary, the R-CNN pipeline takes an image, finds potential object regions, extracts features from those regions using a CNN, classifies the regions using SVMs, refines the bounding box locations using linear regression, and then removes redundant detections using NMS. It's a multi-stage process where each component is trained separately.
