**1. Input Image:**

*   **Input:** The input is the original image that you want to detect objects in. The image needs to be preprocessed to a specific size expected by the YOLO network (e.g., 416x416, 608x608, etc.). This resizing might involve padding to maintain the aspect ratio.

**2. Grid Division:**

*   **Input:** The preprocessed image.
*   **Grid Structure:** The image is divided into an S x S grid (e.g., 13x13, 19x19). Each grid cell is responsible for predicting objects whose center falls within that cell.

**3. Convolutional Feature Extraction (CNN Backbone):**

*   **Input:** The entire input image.
*   **CNN Forward Pass:** The entire image is passed through a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) backbone. This backbone is responsible for extracting features from the image. Common backbones include Darknet, ResNet, or CSPDarknet. The CNN consists of multiple convolutional layers, pooling layers, and activation functions (e.g., ReLU, Leaky ReLU).
*   **Feature Map Output:** The CNN outputs a feature map of a specific size (related to the grid size) with a certain number of channels.  This feature map encodes the learned features from the input image.

**4. Prediction at Each Grid Cell:**

*   **Input:** The feature map from the CNN backbone.
*   **Predictions:** For each grid cell, the network predicts *B* bounding boxes, the confidence score for each bounding box, and *C* class probabilities.
    *   **Bounding Box Prediction:** Each bounding box is defined by its center coordinates (bx, by), width (bw), and height (bh), all relative to the grid cell.
    *   **Confidence Score:** Each bounding box has a confidence score (Pc) representing the probability that the box contains an object and how accurate the box's boundaries are.  This is often calculated as P(Object) * IOU, where IOU is the intersection-over-union between the predicted box and the ground truth.
    *   **Class Probabilities:** Each grid cell predicts conditional class probabilities P(Class_i | Object), representing the probability that the object in that grid cell belongs to a particular class, assuming there is an object present.
*   **Output:** For each grid cell, a tensor of size B * (5 + C) is produced (5 for bx, by, bw, bh, and Pc, and C for class probabilities). Across the entire grid, this results in a tensor of shape S x S x B * (5 + C).

**5. Decoding and Thresholding:**

*   **Input:** The S x S x B * (5 + C) tensor.
*   **Decoding:** The network outputs need to be decoded to get meaningful predictions. This involves:
    *   Converting bounding box coordinates from relative values to absolute image coordinates.
    *   Applying a sigmoid function to the confidence score (Pc) to constrain it between 0 and 1.
    *   Calculating class-specific confidence scores by multiplying the conditional class probabilities P(Class_i | Object) with the confidence score Pc.  This gives you P(Class_i) * IOU for each box and class.
*   **Thresholding:** Remove boxes with a low confidence score (below a predefined threshold). This eliminates many false positives.

**6. Non-Maximum Suppression (NMS):**

*   **Input:** The set of bounding boxes with their associated class-specific confidence scores (P(Class_i) * IOU) that passed the thresholding stage.
*   **NMS Algorithm:** NMS is applied to filter out redundant bounding boxes. Typically, NMS is performed class-wise. For each class:
    *   Sort the bounding boxes by their class-specific confidence scores.
    *   Select the bounding box with the highest confidence score.
    *   Remove all other bounding boxes that have a high overlap (measured by Intersection over Union - IoU) with the selected box. A high IoU suggests that the boxes are predicting the same object.
    *   Repeat the above steps until no more boxes remain.
*   **Output:** A final set of bounding boxes, each representing a detected object with a specific class and location.  These are the final detections.
