## 1. How Computers Detect Objects (General Pipeline)
- **a. Image Preprocessing**:
  - Convert image into a numerical representation (pixels: grayscale/RGB).
  - Apply filters (e.g., smoothing, sharpening, edge detection).
- **b. Feature Extraction**:
  - **Traditional Methods**: Hand-crafted features (e.g., HOG, SIFT, SURF).
  - **Deep Learning (CNNs)**: Automatically learn and extract hierarchical features (from simple edges to complex patterns).
- **c. Object Detection Methods/Strategies**:
  - **Sliding Window Approach** (Early method).
  - **Region-Proposal Based Methods** (e.g., R-CNN family).
  - **Single-Shot Detectors** (e.g., YOLO, SSD).
  - **Transformer-based Detectors** (e.g., DETR).

## 2. Object Detection: Definition
- A computer vision technique that involves:
  - **Identifying** what objects are present in an image or video.
  - **Locating** these objects, typically by drawing **bounding boxes** around them.
  - Often includes **classifying** each detected object.

## 3. Categories of Object Detection Models
- **a. Two-Stage Object Detection (Region Proposal-Based)**:
  - **Process**:
    - Stage 1: Generate potential object regions (region proposals).
    - Stage 2: Classify and refine these proposed regions.
  - **Characteristics**: Generally higher accuracy, better for small/overlapping objects, but slower.
  - **Examples**: R-CNN, Fast R-CNN, Faster R-CNN, Mask R-CNN.
- **b. One-Stage Object Detection (End-to-End, No Explicit Proposals / Proposal-Free)**:
  - **Process**: Directly predict object locations (bounding boxes) and class labels in a single pass. Often uses a grid-based approach.
  - **Characteristics**: Much faster, simpler architecture, suitable for real-time applications, but can be less accurate for small objects.
  - **Examples**: YOLO, SSD, RetinaNet.
- **c. Proposal-Free Object Detection (Transformer-based)**:
  - **Process**: Avoids explicit region proposal mechanisms, often using attention mechanisms (Transformers) or dense prediction strategies.
  - **Characteristics**: Can be very efficient, scales well, accuracy is continually improving.
  - **Examples**: DETR, Vision Transformers (ViTs) adapted for detection.

## 4. Goal of Object Detection
- For a given input image, the primary goal is to create a model (often a "black box" like a neural network) that outputs:
  - **What objects** are present in the image (classification).
  - **Where these objects are located** (localization, typically represented by bounding box coordinates: e.g., $x, y, width, height$).

## 5. Basic Model Design Concepts (Conceptual Lead-in)
- **Feature Extraction**: Use convolutional and pooling layers to extract meaningful features from the image.
- **Classification Head**: A component (e.g., fully connected layers + softmax) to predict class scores for potential objects.
  - *Loss Function*: Typically Cross-Entropy Loss for classification.
- **Localization/Regression Head**: A component (e.g., fully connected layers) to predict bounding box coordinates.
  - *Loss Function*: Typically L2 Loss (Mean Squared Error) or Smooth L1 Loss for regression.
- **Challenge**: How to handle multiple objects of varying sizes and locations.

## 6. Earliest Approach: Sliding Window
- **Concept**:
  1. Define a window (box) of a certain size and aspect ratio.
  2. Slide this window across the entire image at different positions and scales.
  3. For each windowed region:
     - Extract the region as a sub-image.
     - Pass it to a classifier (e.g., a Neural Network) to determine if an object is present and what class it belongs to (including a "background" class).
- **Problems**:
  - **Computational Cost**: Extremely high due to the vast number of possible window positions, scales, and aspect ratios to check $$ (W - w + 1) \times (H - h + 1) $$ positions for one scale, multiplied by many scales/aspect ratios).
  - Not feasible for real-time applications or even moderately sized images.
