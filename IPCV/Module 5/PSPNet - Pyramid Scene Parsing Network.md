#### Definition
- PSPNet, or Pyramid Scene Parsing Network is a convolutional neural network (CNN) based model tailored for semantic segmentation. It aims to label each pixel in an image with a category by analyzing the scene at various level of detail.
- The primary goal of PSPNet is to achieve precise segmentation by combining local information (detailed features of small regions) with global context (overall score understanding), addressing challenges in complex environments where objects and backgrounds vary in scale and context.
- PSPNet is particularly effective for tasks requiring pixel-level predictions, such as autonomous driving, medical imaging, and urban planning.

#### Key Concepts
1. **Scene Parsing**:
	- Parsing refers to breaking down an image to smaller, meaningful components to better understand its structure. PSPNet focuses on parsing to scene to classify every pixel accurately.
2. **Local Details vs Global Context**
	- **Local Details:** Focus on small regions of the image, capturing precise information about individual objects or features
	- **Global Context:** Emphasizes the overall layout and relationships between elements in the scene 
3. **Multi-Scale Analysis**
	- PSPNet leverages a pyramid structure to analyze the image at different resolutions or scales, ensuring it captures both minute details and overall patterns.

#### Architecture of PSPNet
1. **Input Image**
2. **Feature Map Extraction using CNN**
	- The input image is passed through a CNN (such as ResNet), which extracts features like edges, textures and shapes.
	- The output is a feature map, a compact representation of the image containing high-level information.
3. **Pyramid Pooling Module (PPM)**
	- This is the core innovation of PSPNet. The feature map is processed at multiple scales using pooling operations of different sizes (e.g., 1x1, 2x2, 3x3, 6x6).
	- Pooling at various scales captures different levels of context:
	    - Small pooling sizes focus on local details.
	    - Larger pooling sizes capture global context.
	- After pooling, the resulting features are upsampled (resized back to the original feature map size) to maintain spatial coherence.
4. **Concatenation**
	- The features from different pooling scales are merged (concatenated) into a richer feature map, combining local and global information.
5. **Final Convolution**
	- A final convolution layer processes the concatenated feature map to predict labels for each pixel in the image.
6. **Output (Segmentation Map)**
	- The result is a segmented image where each pixel is assigned a class label, represented by different colours (e.g., green for trees, yellow for roads).

#### Applications of PSPNet
- **Urban Planning and Land Use Analysis**:
    - **Local Details**: PSPNet identifies individual elements like buildings, roads, parks, or small water bodies within a city.
    - **Global Context**: It captures the overall layout, such as the distribution of residential, commercial, and industrial areas across large regions.
    - **Impact**: Planners can analyze city layouts to optimize development, track land usage, and monitor environmental impacts.
- **Autonomous Driving**:
    - PSPNet aids in semantic segmentation for identifying drivable areas, road boundaries, and obstacles, ensuring safe navigation by understanding both detailed object boundaries and broader scene context.
- **Complex Scene Understanding**:
    - It is suitable for environments with diverse objects and backgrounds, such as natural landscapes or crowded urban settings, where both fine-grained details and overarching patterns are critical.
#### Advantages of PSPNet
- **Multi-Scale Context Aggregation**: The pyramid pooling module ensures that PSPNet captures contextual information at various levels, leading to more accurate pixel-wise predictions compared to traditional single-scale methods.
- **Improved Segmentation in Complex Scenes**: By combining local and global information, PSPNet handles challenging scenarios where objects vary significantly in size or context.
- **Efficiency in Feature Utilization**: The architecture effectively leverages features extracted by CNNs, enhancing performance without requiring excessive computational resources.
