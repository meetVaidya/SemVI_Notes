## 1. Real Aperture Camera
- **Definition**: The physical opening in a lens through which light passes to reach the camera sensor.
- **Analogy**: The "pupil" of the camera.
- **Function**: Controls the amount of light entering the camera.
  - **Wider Aperture**: More light → brighter image.
  - **Narrower Aperture**: Less light → darker image.
- **Impact on Depth of Field (DOF)**:
  - **Wide Aperture (e.g., f/1.4, f/2.8)**:
    - More light.
    - **Shallow DOF**: Subject in focus, background/foreground blurry (Bokeh effect).
  - **Small Aperture (e.g., f/16, f/22)**:
    - Less light.
    - **Deep/Greater DOF**: More of the scene (foreground to background) is in focus/sharp.

## 2. F-Stops
- **Definition**: A measure of the aperture size. It's the ratio of the lens's focal length to the diameter of the aperture opening.  
  - Formula: $$F\text{-}stop = \frac{\text{Focal Length}}{\text{Aperture Diameter}}$$
- **Key Relationship**: **Smaller f-stop number = Larger aperture size**.  
  - $f/1.4$ is a larger opening than $f/16$.
- **Example Calculation**: 100mm focal length, 25mm aperture diameter → $100/25 = f/4$.
- **Aperture Diameter Calculation**: $$\text{Aperture Diameter} = \frac{\text{Focal Length}}{\text{F-number}} $$

## 3. Focal Length
- **Definition**: The distance between the optical center of the lens and the camera's image sensor when the lens is focused at infinity.
- **Impact on Angle of View & Magnification**:
  - **Shorter Focal Length (e.g., 35mm)**:
    - Wider angle of view.
    - Objects appear smaller, more of the scene is captured.
  - **Longer Focal Length (e.g., 150mm)**:
    - Narrower angle of view (more "zoomed in").
    - Objects appear larger, less of the scene is captured.

## 4. Depth of Field (DOF)
- **Definition**: The range of distance in a scene that appears acceptably sharp in an image.
- **Factors Affecting DOF**:
  - **Aperture**: Primary controller. (Covered above)
  - **Focal Length**: Longer focal lengths tend to produce shallower DOF.
  - **Subject Distance**: Closer subjects tend to have shallower DOF.
- **Summary**:
  - **Shallow DOF**: Achieved with large aperture (small f-number). Isolates subject.
  - **Deep DOF**: Achieved with small aperture (large f-number). Keeps most of the scene sharp.

## 5. Bokeh
- **Definition**: The aesthetic quality of the blur produced in the out-of-focus parts of an image produced by a lens.
- **Achieved by**: Using a large aperture (small f-stop) to create a shallow depth of field.

## 6. Interaction of Light in Photography
- **Light Source (e.g., Sun)**: Emits light towards the subject.
- **Subject**: Light hits the subject; some is reflected.
- **Camera**: Captures the reflected light via its sensor to form an image.
- **Key Aspects**:
  - **Angle of Light**: Affects shadows and highlights.
  - **Intensity of Light**: Determines exposure.
  - **Reflected Light**: Carries color and texture information.

## 7. Pinhole Camera
- **Definition**: A simple camera without a lens, using only a tiny hole (pinhole) to pass light.
- **Principle**: Light travels in straight lines.
- **Image Characteristics**:
  - **Inverted**: Light from the top of an object passes through the pinhole to the bottom of the image plane, and vice-versa. Also left-right reversed.
  - **Blurred**: Due to diffraction and the fact that the pinhole isn't a perfect point.
- **Why no lens?**: Demonstrates basic image formation. A lens is used to focus light and gather more light for a brighter, sharper image.
