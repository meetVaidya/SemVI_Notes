### Motion
- **Motion** refers to the change in the position of the object over time with respect to the reference point.
- It can occur in different forms:
	- **Linear Motion:** Motion in a straight line
	- **Rotational Motion:** Spinning around an axis
	- Oscillatory Motion: Back-and-forth movement 
	- Random Motion: Unpredictable movement

#### Motion Analysis
- **Motion Analysis** involves capturing and analyzing the movement of the objects or people to better understand and optimize performance or design.
- It plays a significant role in fields like:
	- **Sports Science**: Improving athletes’ movements for better performance.
	- **Healthcare**: Evaluating a person's manner of walking.
	- **Animation**: Capturing realistic body movements for characters.
	- **Robotics**: Analyzing mechanical motion for better designs.


#### Key Components of Motion Analysis
1. **Capture**:
	- Involves recording physical movements using **cameras, motion sensors, or wearable technology**.
	- The goal is to gather raw data about the motion, such as joint angles, velocity, or spatial positions.
2. **Analysis**:
	- Refers to **mathematical** and **computational programming** of the captured data to quantify and model the motion.
	- Techniques may include **kinematics, dynamics, signal processing, and machine learning** methods to derive key metrics.
3. **Interpretation**:
	- Converts the analyzed data into **meaningful insights** for various applications, such as sports, healthcare, bio-metrics, robotics or animation.
	- This step helps stakeholders make **practical decisions**.

#### Basic Principles of Motion Analysis
1. **Kinematics: How Things Move**
	- Kinematics focuses on describing motion without delving into the forces causing it. It answers questions about position, speed, and direction. 
	- Key concepts include:
		- **Position**: The location of an object at a specific time (e.g., a ball in your hand).
		- **Velocity**: The speed and direction of an object’s movement (e.g., how fast a runner is moving).
		- **Acceleration**: The rate at which velocity changes, indicating how quickly an object speeds up or slows down.
		- **Displacement**: The total distance moved from the starting point to the endpoint, regardless of the path taken.
		- **Joint Angles**: Specific to human or robotic motion, this measures how body parts or segments bend and move (e.g., the angle of a knee during a squat).
	- Kinematics is essential for tracking movement patterns, like analyzing a runner’s stride efficiency or mapping a robot’s path. It’s purely descriptive, providing a “what’s happening” perspective.
1. **Kinetics: Why Things Move**
	- Kinetics, on the other hand, examines the forces and interactions that cause motion. It builds on kinematics by explaining the “why” behind movement. 
	- Key concepts include:
		- **Force**: A push or pull that initiates or alters motion (e.g., kicking a ball to make it roll).
		- **Torque**: A rotational force that causes spinning or twisting (e.g., turning a door handle).
		- **Momentum**: The measure of how difficult it is to stop a moving object, related to its mass and velocity.
		- **Power**: The rate at which work is done, reflecting how quickly energy is transferred (e.g., sprinting up stairs).
		- **Energy**: The capacity to perform work, such as lifting or moving an object, which fuels motion.
	- Kinetics helps in understanding the causes of motion, such as calculating the force a weightlifter exerts during a lift or determining the torque needed for a robotic arm to rotate. It connects motion to physical interactions.
#### Flow of Motion Analysis
1. **Observation of Movement**: Motion is captured using tools like cameras, sensors, or wearables to record visible changes in position over time.
2. **Data Collection**: Raw data such as positions, velocities, and angles are gathered for further processing.
3. **Reference Frames**: Motion is analyzed relative to a fixed or moving point (e.g., the ground or a body part) to establish context.
4. **Kinematics and Dynamics**: Kinematics describes the movement patterns (e.g., speed and trajectory), while dynamics (kinetics) explains the forces behind them.
5. **Accuracy and Calibration**: Equipment like cameras or sensors must be calibrated to ensure precise measurements, minimizing errors.
6. **Filtering and Signal Processing**: Noise in raw data is smoothed or filtered to improve accuracy.
7. **Interpretation of Results**: The processed data is translated into actionable insights, such as improving athletic performance or aiding rehabilitation.
