## Definition
*   **Dynamic stereo** refers to the process of estimating the **3D structure of a scene that changes over time**.
*   It achieves this by using:
    1.  **Stereo images:** Pairs of images taken from slightly different viewpoints at the same (or nearly the same) time.
    2.  Information about the **motion of the camera or objects** within the scene over time.
Essentially, it combines stereo vision (for 3D reconstruction at a single time instant) with motion analysis (to understand how that 3D structure evolves).
## Applications
Dynamic stereo and motion parameter estimation are widely used in various fields:
* **Robotics:** For navigation and manipulation (e.g., a robot understanding its 3D environment and how it changes to move or interact with objects).
* **Autonomous Vehicles:** For obstacle detection and avoidance (e.g., identifying other moving vehicles, pedestrians, and their 3D positions and trajectories).
* **Augmented Reality (AR):** For integrating virtual objects into real-world scenes realistically (e.g., understanding the 3D geometry and motion of the real world to correctly place and animate virtual elements).
