- Spatio-temporal analysis in computer vision and related fields involves studying how objects or events change over both space (location) and time. 
- It combines spatial data (where things are) with temporal data (when things happen) to uncover patterns, movements, or trends. 
- This analysis is crucial for understanding dynamic systems where both position and timing matter.

- Key Points
    - Spatial Aspect: Focuses on the physical location or arrangement of objects (e.g., mapping vehicle paths at an intersection).
    - Temporal Aspect: Examines changes over time (e.g., identifying peak traffic hours).
    - Applications: Used in traffic monitoring, surveillance, action recognition, and smart city planning to detect anomalies or optimize systems.
    - Example: Tracking traffic congestion across different intersections (space) throughout the day (time) to identify rush hours and bottlenecks, as highlighted in the provided document.
