## Definition

* **Optical flow** is the pattern of motion of **pixels** in an image sequence caused by the movement of objects or the camera.
* In computer vision, optical flow refers to the pattern of **apparent motion** of objects, surfaces, and edges in a visual scene caused by the relative motion between an observer (an eye or a camera) and the scene.
* Pixels will move in a consistent pattern if the objects they represent are in motion.
