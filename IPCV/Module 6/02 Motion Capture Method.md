Motion capture is the process of recording the movement of objects or people. There are two primary approaches:

## Marker-Based Systems

*   **How They Work:** Reflective markers are placed on key anatomical landmarks. Cameras track these markers to capture motion.
*   **Advantages:**
    *   High accuracy and reliability.
    *   Widely used in gait labs and film production for CGI.
*   **Considerations:**
    *   Requires a controlled environment.
    *   Can be time-consuming to set up.

## Markerless Systems

*   **How They Work:** Algorithms analyze video footage to detect and track the human body's natural contours and features without the need for physical markers.
*   **Advantages:**
    *   More natural movement without the encumbrance of markers.
    *   Easier to use in varied environments.
*   **Considerations:**
    *   May have lower accuracy compared to marker-based systems.
    *   Requires advanced computer vision technology.
*   **Algorithms:** Examples include Movenet, OpenPose, DeepLabCut, Iterative Closest Point (ICP), and many more.
