#### Calibration Definition
- Calibration in motion analysis refers to the process of setting up and adjusting equipment, such as cameras or sensors to ensure accurate measurements of movement. 
- Calibration **helps** <u>minimize errors and ensures that the collected data reflects the actual movement accurately</u>.

#### Marker-based & Marker-less Systems
|**Aspect**|**Marker-Based Systems**|**Markerless Systems**|
|---|---|---|
|**Definition**|Track motion by placing reflective markers on key points of the body or object.|Track motion without physical markers, relying on cameras and AI algorithms.|
|**Setup Process**|Requires attaching small reflective markers to joints or specific areas (e.g., knees, elbows).|No physical markers needed; uses video footage directly for analysis.|
|**Capture Method**|Multiple cameras emit infrared light, which reflects off markers to record 3D positions.|Cameras record motion from various angles, and AI identifies key points on the body.|
|**Tracking Mechanism**|Cameras detect reflected light to track marker positions in 3D space.|AI software detects and follows key points (like joints) directly from video data.|
|**Accuracy**|Highly accurate due to precise marker placement and direct tracking.|Slightly less accurate in some cases due to reliance on algorithms and potential occlusions.|
|**Ease of Use**|More invasive and time-consuming due to marker placement and setup.|Non-invasive and easier to set up since no markers are required.|
|**Flexibility**|Limited to environments where markers can be worn and infrared cameras are available.|More flexible; can be used in diverse settings with standard cameras.|
|**Applications**|Commonly used in sports, biomechanics, and animation for detailed movement tracking.|Often used in rehabilitation, sports, and gaming for non-invasive tracking.|
|**Cost**|Generally more expensive due to specialized equipment (infrared cameras, markers).|Typically less expensive as it often requires only standard cameras and software.|
|**Challenges**|Markers can fall off or be obscured, interrupting data collection.|May struggle with occlusion, low lighting, or complex backgrounds affecting AI detection.|
