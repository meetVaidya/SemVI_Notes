#### Action Recognition
- Action recognition in computer vision is the process of identifying specific behaviour or movements performed by individuals or objects in video or image sequences. 
- It involves analyzing visual data to detect actions like running, jumping, or waving, often using machine learning to understand motion patterns.
- Think of it as teaching a computer to "watch" a video and recognise whatâ€™s happening, such as identifying a soccer player kicking a ball.

#### Action Classification
- Action classification is the task of categorizing detected actions into predefined groups or labels. 
- It sorts videos or sequences based on the type of activity being performed, such as labelling a video as "dancing" or "cooking." 
- Typically, it employs deep learning models like convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to learn and assign categories based on patterns in large datasets.

#### Action Localization
- Action localization goes a step further by not only identifying what action is happening but also determining _where_ and _when_ it occurs in the video. 
- It pinpoints the specific time frames or segments (temporal information) and sometimes spatial regions where the action takes place, providing a more detailed analysis. 
- For instance, in a long video, it can highlight the exact moments a person jumps during a game.
