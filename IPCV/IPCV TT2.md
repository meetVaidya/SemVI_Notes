case study type questions are expected in end sem as well as tt2
check proper comparison 
justify type question should answer why u choose X and why not Y and Z so disadvantages if u choose y and z are expected
interpretation of numerical final ans is expected
underline main points 
handwriting and presentation should be neat clean
only 15 marks paper
